## People Learn Differently

Some people like to dive right into code, and work backwards from examples to understand how things work.
Others like to read a high-level overview that introduces overall design strategies and intentions of the software. 
From this perspective the examples are better framed and thus more easily understood.

Jekyll-bootstrap is predicated on the latter strategy because I believe it is a more efficient long-term learning strategy. 

However I have tried to comprehensively document the code and examples contained in Jekyll-bootstrap so 
please dive right into the source if you would prefer to.

## How to consume Jekyll-Bootstrap

### Start with Jekyll Introduction

The intro explains why and how Jekyll works the way it does.
The purpose here is _not_ to learn specifically how to do any one thing. Rather it is to
learn the _nature_ of Jekyll, and why the code, examples, and helpers are built the way they are.

### Jump into Usage OR Learn the API

The next step is up to you. If you want to dive right into setting up your Jekyll site
you should read the articles under **Usage**. You can reference the API and source if you don't understand something.

If you prefer to know what is going on first you should read all the **API** articles.
The API articles provide the meat of _what you can do_ in Jekyll. 

From there the Usage and Helper sections outline specifically _how to do things_ in Jekyll.


## Read the Source

No matter how you learn, you should always read the source code. Play with it, break it, hack it, 
live it, breathe it. There is no substitute for reading and experimenting with the source code.

Good luck!
